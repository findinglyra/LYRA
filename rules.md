When examining problems and proferring solutions only generate new code if it is highly necessary. look to improve the code logic first and edit the present code before generating news ones. this is to make sure only very necessary code is generated too keep code length at a good size and code is compulsorily optimally written.


After making changes, make sure to confirm that the changes are made and the required result is achieved. if the result is not as expected, make the necessary changes and confirm again. repeat this process until the required result is achieved.

Findinglyra Brand Document: Connecting Souls Through Sound & Cosmic Alignment
1. Brand Overview
Brand Name: Findinglyra

5. Visual Identity Guidelines (Concepts for LLM)
Findinglyra's visual identity should be modern, vibrant, sophisticated, and deeply evocative of music, with a complementary celestial and mystical undertone.
Logo Concept:
An abstract, fluid representation of sound waves that subtly forms the shape of a lyre or intertwined musical notes.
Clean, minimalist lines with a dynamic feel.
Could incorporate a gradient from the primary to secondary color.
It should also subtly incorporate a star or constellation pattern within its negative space, as an accompanying element, or as a subtle sparkle/glow effect, reinforcing the Lyra constellation aspect.
Example: A stylized 'F' or 'L' that incorporates a subtle sound wave or musical note motif, with a few minimalist star points or a faint constellation line integrated.
Color Palette:
Primary: #2A2A4A (Deep Indigo/Midnight Blue) - Represents sophistication, depth, and the night sky where celestial harmony resides. This color is crucial for establishing the cosmic theme.
Secondary: #00C2C2 (Electric Teal) - Represents vibrancy, discovery, innovation, and a fresh, modern feel. Can evoke distant nebulae.
Accent 1: #FF6B6B (Bright Coral/Salmon) - Represents passion, energy, warmth, and excitement. Can symbolize a vibrant star.
Accent 2: #FFD166 (Soft Gold/Amber) - Represents warmth, quality, and a touch of classic elegance. Evokes starlight and cosmic glow.
Neutrals:
#F8F8F8 (Off-White) - Clean, spacious background.
#A0A0A0 (Medium Gray) - For secondary text, borders.
#505050 (Dark Gray) - For subtle shadows, disabled states.
Typography:
Primary Font (Headlines & UI Elements): Inter (or a similar modern, sans-serif, highly legible font).
Rationale: Clean, contemporary, excellent readability across all screen sizes, and a friendly yet professional feel. Use varying weights (Bold for headlines, Medium for subheadings).
**Secondary Font (Body Text): Inter (Regular weight).
Rationale: Consistency and optimal readability for longer text blocks.
Usage:
Headlines: Inter Bold, larger sizes.
Subheadings: Inter Medium.
Body Text: Inter Regular.
Buttons/Labels: Inter SemiBold.
Imagery & Photography Style:
Authentic & Candid: Photos should feel real, unposed, and diverse. Show people genuinely enjoying music (listening, dancing, at concerts, with headphones).
Vibrant & Dynamic: Incorporate natural light, rich colors, and dynamic compositions. Avoid overly saturated or artificial-looking filters.
Music-Focused: Integrate subtle musical elements where appropriate (e.g., a blurred background of a stage, a person wearing headphones, a record player).
Abstract Elements: Use abstract sound wave patterns, light trails, or subtle gradients as background elements or overlays to reinforce the musical theme. These can seamlessly blend with cosmic dust, nebulae-like textures, subtle star patterns, or faint, abstract constellation lines. The celestial elements should be atmospheric and complementary, not literal or overwhelming.
Illustration Style: If illustrations are used, they should be minimalist, modern, and align with the color palette, using clean lines and a friendly aesthetic, potentially incorporating subtle star or cosmic motifs.

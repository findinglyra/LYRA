# LYRA Development Roadmap & Guidelines

## Project Vision
LYRA aims to become the premier music-based social networking platform, connecting individuals through their shared music tastes and creating meaningful relationships based on musical compatibility.

## Core Development Principles

### Knowledge Management
- **Document Everything**:
  * Discovered bugs and their fixes
  * Performance optimizations
  * Edge cases and solutions
  * Implementation insights
  * State-specific rule nuances
- **Before suggesting solutions**:
  1. Check if similar issues were previously addressed
  2. Review documented solutions and learnings
  3. Apply accumulated knowledge to prevent repeated issues
  4. Build upon previous optimizations
- **After resolving issues**:
  1. Document the root cause
  2. Record the solution and rationale
  3. Update relevant documentation

### Development Workflow
- **Feature Implementation**:
  1. Create detailed specifications before implementation
  2. Follow a test-driven development approach where appropriate
  3. Conduct code reviews for all significant changes
  4. Document design decisions and architectural choices

- **Code Quality**:
  1. Follow established project coding standards
  2. Write comprehensive tests for new features
  3. Maintain type safety throughout the codebase
  4. Optimize for performance and accessibility

### User Experience Priorities
- Ensure seamless music integration experiences
- Optimize matching algorithms based on musical preferences
- Create intuitive profile creation processes
- Design for inclusive accessibility
- Prioritize real-time communication reliability

## Phase 1: Core Foundation (Current)
- Establish user authentication system
- Implement basic profile creation
- Create music preference selection interface
- Develop initial matching algorithm
- Build basic chat functionality

## Phase 2: Enhanced Features
- Implement advanced matching based on listening history
- Introduce group chat capabilities
- Add music sharing features
- Build community forums and discussion boards
- Create event discovery for music-related gatherings

## Phase 3: Growth & Expansion
- Integrate with additional music streaming services
- Implement recommendation engine for new music discovery
- Add video chat capabilities
- Develop content creation tools for musicians
- Build analytics dashboard for users to track musical journey

## Technical Debt Management
- Regular refactoring sprints
- Dependency updates and security audits
- Performance optimization cycles
- Accessibility compliance reviews

## Collaboration Guidelines
- Pull requests should reference related issues
- Commit messages should be clear and descriptive
- Code reviews should focus on functionality, performance, and maintainability
- Documentation should be updated alongside code changes

## Release Process
- Feature branches → Development → Staging → Production
- Comprehensive testing at each stage
- Release notes to document all changes
- Post-deployment verification

## Critical Operational Directives

### A. Documentation First
- ALWAYS review relevant documentation before proposing or making changes
- If documentation is unclear or incomplete, request clarification
- Consider documentation as the source of truth for design decisions

### B. Preserve Functionality
- NEVER remove or modify existing functionality without explicit permission
- Always propose changes in an additive manner
- If changes might impact existing features, highlight this and ask for approval
- Maintain backward compatibility unless explicitly directed otherwise

### C. Documentation Maintenance
- UPDATE documentation immediately after any code changes
- DOCUMENT new learnings, insights, or discovered edge cases
- ADD examples for any new or modified functionality
- MAINTAIN documentation hierarchy:
  * mental_model.md for conceptual updates
  * implementation_details.md for technical changes
  * gotchas.md for new edge cases or warnings
  * quick_reference.md for updated parameters or configs

### D. Change Management
- Before implementing changes:
  1. Review relevant documentation
  2. Propose changes with clear rationale
  3. Highlight potential impacts
  4. Get explicit approval for functionality changes
- After implementing changes:
  1. Update relevant documentation
  2. Add new learnings
  3. Update examples if needed
  4. Verify documentation consistency

### E. Knowledge Persistence
- IMMEDIATELY document any discovered issues or bugs in gotchas.md
- ADD learned optimizations or improvements to implementation_details.md
- RECORD all edge cases and their solutions
- UPDATE mental_model.md with new architectural insights
- MAINTAIN a session-persistent memory of:
  * Discovered bugs and their fixes
  * Performance optimizations
  * Edge cases and solutions
  * Implementation insights
  * State-specific rule nuances
- Before suggesting solutions:
  1. Check if similar issues were previously addressed
  2. Review documented solutions and learnings
  3. Apply accumulated knowledge to prevent repeated issues
  4. Build upon previous optimizations
- After resolving issues:
  1. Document the root cause
  2. Record the solution and rationale
  3. Update relevant documentation
  4. Add prevention strategies to gotchas.md
